SUMMARY = "Stressful Application Test"
DESCRIPTION = "\
               Stressful Application Test (or stressapptest, its unix name) \
               is a memory interface test. It tries to maximize randomized traffic to memory \
               from processor and I/O, with the intent of creating a realistic high load \
               situation in order to test the existing hardware devices in a computer. \
